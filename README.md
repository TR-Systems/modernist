# Modernist Theme for Github Pages by TR Systems
### Under Construction!

This theme started out by copying the design of the built-in [Github Pages Modernist Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/modernist){:target="_blank"}.

I only copied what was needed then modified the style sheet, default html and config to what you see here.

All content in the header and footer is supplied by variables in _config.yml with the exception of the Home Page button.

Two additional configurable link buttons are provided for in the upper right corner of the header. If not configured, they will not be displayed. The default html file controls that and the style sheet controls how they are built and squeezed together. Rather tricky.

The repo has two branches. I apply all changes and new content to the top level "edit" branch, then pull them down into the "publish" branch for build. I'm all new at github so there might be a better way to manage changes and publishing but this works for me.

This page (README.md) is your home page, which will be built as index.html

Experienced users know all that and can take it from here. Beginners may want to check back or send me a message.

### Google Analytics
There is a sample google analytics snippet in the _includes folder, but the statement to include it in the head section of the default html ***is commented out*** so you can come back after you get your site set up and put it back in, after you have updated the snippet. That's all there is to it.
