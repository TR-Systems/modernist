My plan is to use this theme for development and testing of new features for my tr-systems site, as my time and interest dictates.

Next up is better @Media settings for tablets and phones and then better navigation.

For me, this is all just for grins and giggles folks, perfect retirement hobby for me while in the deep freeze of the great white north. 

Yah hey, ya hosers! Rock on!
