## Get Started
This is not an introduction to GitHub. It's easy to create an account. After you login, use these steps to create a new repository and publish it "as is" without editing any files. This simply confirms that your site will build and deploy.

1. Open [TR-System/modernist](https://github.com/tr-systems/modernist){:target="_blank"}
2. Click the button in the upper right to <span style="border:2px solid silver;border-radius:6px;padding:0 4px;background-color:lightgreen;">Use this Template</span>
3. Give your repo a web-friendly name. DO NOT include all branches. If using a personal account, you must create a public repo, and only one of your public repos can have a website. This restriction does not apply for Team accounts.
4. Click the button to create your new repo.
5. The repo will be copied and created.
6. Create the publish branch.
7. Click the repo Settings button
8. In the nav bar on the left, scroll down and click **Pages**
9. Under Build and Deploy: Deploy from branch: **publish** /root. Click **Save**.
10. GitHub will kick off the Pages Build and Deploy action
11. Click on Actions to watch that process run
12. Go back to Settings/Pages and click the link to visit your site

Voila, web sites made easy! Ha!

All you need to do now is start editing and writing. And have fun!
