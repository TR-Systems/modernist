### Under Perpetual Construction and Testing
I am using this as a learning tool for developing and testing changes for my [TR-Systems site](https://tr-systems.github.io/web/){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to grab it and go. To do so, cick here to [Get Started Today!](getstarted.md).

This design started out by copying the GitHub Pages Modernist Theme, which [looks like this](https://pages-themes.github.io/modernist/){:target="_blank"}.

### Usage
Good for static display of system documentation and other articles of interest with a clean simple design. Good for large documents that need a table of contents for easier navigation.
